  <description summary="Control brightness management of outputs">
    This protocol allows clients to control brightness management
    of outputs that are currently part of the compositor space. The
    intent is to allow special clients like desktop shells to set
    brightness.

    To modify outputs not currently part of the compositor space see
    wlr-output-management.

    Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
    backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes
    may be added together with the corresponding interface version bump.
    Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in
    the protocol and interface names and resetting the interface version.
    Once the protocol is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the
    version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the
    interface version number is reset.

        This event indicates that the output brightness management
        is no longer valid. This can happen for a number of reasons,
        including:
        - The output doesn't support brightness management
        - Another client already has exclusive brightness management control
          for this output
        - The output disappeared

        Upon receiving this event, the client should destroy this object.
